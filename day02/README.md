# 📅 Day 2 — DSA Practice (Oct 15, 2025)

Today’s focus was on **basic array and string manipulation problems** in Python.  
These are foundational problems that help build problem-solving speed and confidence for interviews.

## 🧮 Problems Solved
1. **Find Max in Array** — Iterate through an array and return the maximum element.  
2. **Reverse String** — Reverse a string using Python logic without built-in reverse functions.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Array traversal
- String manipulation
- Edge case handling (empty arrays, single characters)
- Writing clean functions with test cases

## 🧑‍💻 Approach
- Wrote reusable functions with docstrings.
- Handled input validation and corner cases.
- Focused on clarity, not shortcuts.
- Added time complexity notes in code.

## ⏳ Complexity
- Find Max in Array → **O(n)**  
- Reverse String → **O(n)**
